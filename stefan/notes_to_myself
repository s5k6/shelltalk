FIXME's
=======

  * Maybe better to rename some programs to not conflict with the
    system call they demonstrate.  May ease the discussion.

  * check `vpcc` arguments: missing mode argument of `open` not
    recognized?

  * make sure this maps nicely to markdown

  * Alternatives to `fork`+`exec`:

    `vfork`(2) may be slightly faster, but is much more difficult to
    use.

    `posix_spawn`(3) is similar to, but weaker than, a combination of
    `fork` and `exec`.

    `clone`(2) may be used to implement `fork`, it offers more control
    over sharing of the execution context.


Session preparation
===================

  * shell config:

        set +C +u
        shopt -u failglob
        export QUOTING_STYLE=literal

  * either disable git-prompt, or do it outside a git repo

  * `inotify . -- make`

  * touch 'hello world'



Helpers
=======

inotify . -- make

for i in *.c; do
    bin="${i%.c}";
    grep -Eq "${bin}" .gitignore && continue;
    echo "${bin}" >> .gitignore;
done

make index.html
