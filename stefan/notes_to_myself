FIXME's
=======

  * check `vpcc` arguments: missing mode argument of `open` not
    recognized?

  * make sure this maps nicely to markdown


  * Alternatives to `fork`+`exec`:

    `vfork`(2) may be slightly faster, but is much more difficult to
    use.

    `posix_spawn`(3) is similar to, but weaker than, a combination of
    `fork` and `exec`.

    `clone`(2) may be used to implement `fork`, it offers more control
    over sharing of the execution context.


Session preparation
===================

  * make sure it's not an alias: ls

  * shell config: set +C +u; shopt -u failglob

  * `inotify . -- make`


Helpers
=======

inotify . -- make

for i in *.c; do
    bin="${i%.c}";
    grep -Eq "${bin}" .gitignore && continue;
    echo "${bin}" >> .gitignore;
done

make index.html
