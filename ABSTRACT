Abstract

Linux Shell Programming may feel revolting.  If something like
“ordinary programming” existed at all, then Shell Programming would
not be it.  But why is it so awkward?

As usual, understanding the mechanisms of a programming environment
greatly improves one's confidence and problem solving skills.  To this
end, one half of the course will explain how the Linux Shell does its
thing, hoping to transform one's relationship with the shell from
adversarial to sympathetic.

We're not trying to convey how to do something, but rather how to
think in order to figure out what to do.


Required: Very basic shell knowledge.  Superficial C (even reading
          pseudocode would suffice)
